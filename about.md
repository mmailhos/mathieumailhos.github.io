<p>I'm a software engineer, although I am more often refered as a DevOps.<br>
On the tech side, my passion is to develop products, starting from scratch,
up to its delivery on the market. My favorite part is building the infrastructure:
hands-on systems and thinking of solutions to overcome performance and scalability challenges.</p>

<p>Besides that, I have what people call the <i>millenial</i> spirit. Making an
impact and learning on a daily basis are the two things that matter the most
to me. I love being involved in business and marketing discussions, always trying
  to bring <i>out of the box</i> ideas, pushing points of view to their limits in the purpose of
keep moving forward.</p>

<p>I believe that the only way to make an actual disruptive product is to
mix creativity and open-mindedness with strong technical skills.</p>
