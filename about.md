<p>I'm a software engineer even though I am more often refered as <i>DevOps</i>.
On the tech side, my passion is to develop a product, starting from scratch,
up to its delivery on the market. My favorite part is building the infrastructure,
hands-on the systems and answering performance and scalability challenges.</p>

<p>Besides that, I have what people call the <i>millenial</i> spirit. Making an
impact and learning on a daily basis are the two things that matter the most
to me. I love being involved in business and marketing discussions, always trying
to bring <i>out of the box</i> ideas, to challenge points of view in the purpose of
keep moving forward.</p>

<p> I believe that the only way to make an actual disruptive product is to
mix creativity and open-mindedness with strong technical skills </p>
