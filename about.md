<p>I'm a software engineer even though I am more often refered as 'DevOps'.
On the tech side, my passion is to develop a product, starting from scratch,
up to its delivery on the market. What I prefer the most is the infrastructure
part and to answer performance and scalability potential issues.</p>

<p>Nevertherless, I have what people call the 'millenial' spirit. Making an
impact and learning on a daily basis are the two things that matters the most
to me. I love being part of business and marketting discussions, always trying
to bring "out of the box" ideas, to challenge points of view in the purpose of
keep moving forward.</p>
